Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

### Preamble

The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software and other kinds of works. The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions of a program—to make sure it remains free software for all its users.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. To understand the concept, you should think of “free” as in “free speech,” not as in “free beer.”

This General Public License applies to most software released by the Free Software Foundation and other authors. You can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of this License, as published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 3 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.

### Terms and Conditions

#### 0\. Definitions.

\- "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.
- "The Program" refers to any work licensed under this License.
- "You" refers to the licensee of the Program.
- "Source Code" refers to the preferred form of the Program for making modifications.

#### 1\. You may copy, distribute, and modify the Program, as long as you meet the following conditions:

\- You must provide the source code or make it available.
- You must state any changes you made to the Program.
- You must preserve this license.

#### 2\. You may convey the Program under the terms of this License.

\- If you distribute modified versions of the Program, you must make sure the modified program is also licensed under the GPL.

#### 3\. No Warranty.

\- This software is provided "as is", without warranty of any kind, either express or implied, including but not limited to the warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and noninfringement.

#### 4\. If you wish to include GPL-licensed code in a proprietary program, you must make the source code of the entire program available under the GPL.

This license was adopted by the Free Software Foundation and is designed to protect users' freedom to use, distribute, and modify software while making sure that any derivative works remain open-source and free.
