Project Overview
----------------

This project provides a simple interface to manage CSV files. It allows users to:

*   Create a new CSV file with predefined columns.
*   Add, update, or delete rows in the CSV file.
*   View the contents of the CSV file in a terminal or in a web browser via a Flask web interface.

You can interact with the CSV file either via the command line or through a web interface for easy visualization of the data.

Technologies Used
-----------------

*   **Python**: The primary programming language for the project.
*   **Flask**: A lightweight web framework used to render CSV data in a browser.
*   **Pandas**: Used for reading, writing, and manipulating CSV data.
*   **argparse**: Handles command-line arguments for CRUD operations.
*   **JS and Bootstrap**: Beautifying the web interface.
